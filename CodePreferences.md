Read the main README.md in the project root for an overall flavour of the game/coding structure. This is C#.
I prefer comments above functions/methods. along with a commented line of ========================================================= so i can easily see when editing code in godot
I prefer some comment at top of each script to explain what the script is doing.
I prefer a .md file inside each major folder to explain whats inside this folder.
I prefer a masterconfig file inside each major capslock folder to group easily frequent tweakable settings
I prefer you organizing functions/methods into regions when appropriate.
I prefer to organize my scripts for ease of finding in future etc.
I do like you to vertically compress code where possible, so it's a little easier to read on screen.
I also prefer my code to be not overly complex, more like simplicity, while still achieving the gameplay I desire + performance friendly
I like re-using code when possible, I.E we use a helper function for staggered checks for enemies and things, similar to my Macros i had in my previous gamemaker vector game etc.
Please keep in mind I like optimization where possible too. Performance oriented.
I like keeping things containted and modular for easy expansion and easy tweaking of things without having to rewrite other things.
I like Node helpers as well so that the scene trees to not become cluttered. we should group common things in a shared plain node.
I like grouping similar variables in structs / export groups for inspector so it shows sub categories etc.
Check out my isometric 3d and isometric 2d github repositories for code/folder structure references.
If an .md file is available in the project for a section/feature/mechanic we are editing, refer to the .md as sometimes it will have extra context. Some might be outdated. Update md files appropriately when completing work.
Only do one commit for github per job instead of multiple commits.

## Performance-first rules for every new mechanic

**Design for low idle cost from the beginning, not just functional correctness.** Before writing a feature, identify what activates it, what work happens while active, and exactly what stops that work afterward. Avoid introducing an always-running `_Process` or `_PhysicsProcess` by default.

- **Inactive means dormant:** If an effect is off, intensity is zero, or its animation has finished, it should not keep simulating, checking objects, redrawing, or rewriting GPU properties. Use `SetProcess(false)`, `SetPhysicsProcess(false)`, emitter shutdown, and explicit activation where suitable. Keep a way for UI/config changes to wake it without idle polling.
- **Prefer triggers and signals:** A tree should process fire only after `TryIgnite()` triggers ignition; an axe-hit wobble should animate only after a hit and stop afterward. Do not give every idle tree a fire-checking loop.
- **Rain and snowfall example:** Zero intensity means OFF, not invisible particles still updating. Suspend emission, splash work and unnecessary callbacks; allow intentional fade-out/remaining effects to finish, then sleep. Changing the slider or weather state must reactivate the effect directly.
- **Use shared systems:** Prefer one manager for many objects, pooled effects, shared GPU particles/materials, and cached data instead of thousands of per-instance idle loops.
- **Only update changed data:** Don't assign the same shader uniforms, settings, particle bounds or light properties every frame. Apply configuration when changed, and throttle legitimately continuous cosmetic changes if it preserves the appearance.
- **Respect streaming and visibility:** Limit queries to nearby or active chunks; register/unregister on spawn and unload. Avoid full-world/group scans every frame. Suspend off-screen cosmetic work without breaking persistent simulation.
- **Keep hot paths allocation-free where practical:** Avoid repeated scene-tree searches, resource loads, temporary lists/arrays, LINQ, material creation, or redundant `QueueRedraw()` in frequent callbacks.
- **Do not over-optimize away necessary animation:** Clock, sunlight and active wind may be genuinely continuous. Justify their update frequency and avoid duplicate calculations; don't freeze functioning visuals.
- **Verify idle and active performance:** Test never-active, activation, deactivation, settled zero state, reactivation, many instances, and chunk unload/reload. Use Godot profiler/frame traces to verify idle callbacks/draws and allocations are absent or intentionally minimal. Do not claim measured improvements without measurements.
- **Include a performance handoff:** When implementing, describe the wake-up trigger, sleep/shutdown condition, any remaining idle per-frame work, scaling strategy, and what was actually tested.

**Default design question:** What makes this mechanic run, what makes it stop, and what is its cost while nothing is happening?

These requirements apply alongside the existing modular, data-driven, C# and documentation preferences.
